# Salary Prediction System

This project is an end-to-end machine learning application that predicts employee salary using demographic, financial, and business-related attributes. The system applies proper data preprocessing, feature encoding, and a trained machine learning pipeline to deliver consistent and reliable salary predictions. An interactive Streamlit web application presents key insights and enables real-time prediction through a clean, dark-themed interface with smooth animations.
